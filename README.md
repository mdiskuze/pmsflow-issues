  # PMS Flow - User Manual

  ## 1. What PMS Flow Does

  PMS Flow helps you:

  - log daily symptoms
  - view cycle predictions
  - view fertility window estimates

  PMS Flow is a tracking and estimation app. It is **not** a medical diagnosis tool.

  ## 4. Logging Period Data

  - Use **Log period start** when bleeding begins.
  - Set end date when bleeding stops.
  - For ongoing bleeding, leave end date empty and update later.
  - If cycle timing changes (earlier/later), log real dates; predictions will adapt.

  ## 5. Predictions and Fertility Estimates

  - Predicted dates are estimates based on your history.
  - Confidence depends on consistency and number of recorded cycles.
  - Fertility window and ovulation markers are estimates, not guarantees.
  - You can adjust prediction settings in **Settings > Cycle predictions**.

  - Remove identifying info before sharing screenshots/issues.
  - If your cycle changes are unusual for you, or symptoms are severe, consult a healthcare professional.
